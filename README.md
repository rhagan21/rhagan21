# Hello!

I'm Rachel. I work as a Software Engineer III at [27Global](https://www.27global.com/). I love using code to build things and solve problems!

## Currently Learning
Python and Ruby. Diving into the backend and databases to round out my development skills.

## Skills
I've spent the most time professionally developing web apps using TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Angular, HTML and CSS.

Add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-hagan/) and include a message about where you ran into me. :)

## When I'm not busy coding, I spend my time:
- Taking care of my menagerie of pets (1 cat, 2 dogs and 6 rats!)
- Attending way too many book club meetings
- Tending to my garden and backyard orchard
- Making and appreciating arts and crafts - I especially love fiber art and outsider or folk art!
- Spending quality time with my wife Kate, and my family and friends.
